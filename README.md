Convert an OpenAPI spec to LangGraph tools ðŸª„

## Concepts
1. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) is a framework for developing apps powered by large language models (LLMs).
2. [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), introduced by 
`LangChain` starting from v0.2, facilitates building [Agents](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/agents/) based apps that leverage and extend a LLM to perform tasks outside of its traditional domain. The heart of an agent is [Tool calls](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/tool_calling/#tool-calls).
3. [OpenAPI ](https://learn.openapis.org/introduction.html) Specification (OAS) is a standard format for defining APIs, allowing both humans and machines to understand the capabilities of a service without accessing its source code, documentation, or network traffic.

Companies worldwide have invested billions ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° into developing APIs. In the new AI era, a question begs, how to leverage the power of natural language processing to consume the APIs while incurring minimum costs and preserving existing investments.

**openapi2tools** addresses the challenge by converting and encapsulating an OpenAPI specification JSON into a domain-specific LangGraph `agent`, with each API represented as a `tool`.


## Installation and Usage

**openapi2tools** can be installed with pip,

```bash
pip install openapi2tools
```
After installation, you run the tool in a command line to generate an agent source file from a OpenAPI JSON ([example json](./MockServer/openapi.json))
```bash
openapi2tools <your_openapi_json_file> <output_python_file_name>
```

## Anatomy of an Agent for a Chatbot

The [MockServer folder](./MockServer/README.md) implements a REST API based service and provides an OpenAPI JSON, [openapi.json](./MockServer/openapi.json).

**openapi2tools** is supposed to run against the `openapi.json` to generate a fully encapsulated Agent ([moviesAPi.py](./Chatbot/moviesApi.py)).

The [Chatbot folder](./Chatbot/README.md) contains an example implementation of a Chatbot ([movies.py](./Chatbot/movies.py)). It then utilizes the `Agent` geneatrated above to call (a.k.a. `Tool calls`) the `Mockserver`, when a user chats with the OpenAI LLM.
